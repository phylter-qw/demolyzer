FIXED: Added support for when 1 player drops mid game. No support yet for more than 1 player dropping
FIXED: Incorrect ping calculation for ghost players

ADDED: Weapon accuracy %

<Cyanide```> changed dir during demo playback
glitches in some charts
older MVDs may not decode
Some packs or entities on the map may not 'pick up' correctly (usually health boxes, or sometimes a dropped pack)
Sorting end of game stats also sorts team stats (ideally team stats shold remain at the bottom)
powerups are shown in 1on1s and 2on2s even though they are not 'spawned'
